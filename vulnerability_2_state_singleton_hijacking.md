# Critical State Singleton Hijacking - Cross-User Fund Theft

## Project: Injective Swap Contract

## Severity: Critical

## Category: Reentrancy / Access Control / State Management

---

## üîç Description

A critical vulnerability exists in the swap contract's state management system where the `SWAP_OPERATION_STATE` singleton can be overwritten by any user during multi-step swap operations. This creates a race condition that allows attackers to hijack victim transactions mid-flight, redirecting funds to attacker-controlled addresses.

## üìú Affected Code

```rust
// In contracts/swap/src/state.rs
pub const SWAP_OPERATION_STATE: Item<SwapOperationState> = Item::new("swap_operation_state");

// In contracts/swap/src/swap.rs
// Vulnerable state loading during SubMsg reply
let current_state = SWAP_OPERATION_STATE.load(deps.storage)?;
// Attacker can overwrite this state between swap initiation and reply processing
```

## üß† Root Cause

The root cause is **improper singleton state management in a multi-user environment**:

1. **Global Shared State**: `SWAP_OPERATION_STATE` is a singleton accessible to all users
2. **No Access Control**: Any user can overwrite the global state during their own operations
3. **Timing Window**: Multi-step swaps create windows where state can be overwritten
4. **State Confusion**: SubMsg replies load whatever state is currently stored, regardless of ownership

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Exploitability

**EXPLOITABLE: YES**

### Attack Scenario:

1. **Victim Initiation**: Alice starts a multi-step swap, setting `SWAP_OPERATION_STATE` with her details
2. **State Overwrite**: Bob initiates his own swap, overwriting the global state with his parameters
3. **Reply Processing**: Alice's SubMsg reply executes but loads Bob's state from storage
4. **Fund Redirection**: Alice's funds are processed according to Bob's state, sending funds to Bob's address

### Technical Attack Flow:
```rust
// Step 1: Alice starts swap
SWAP_OPERATION_STATE.save(deps.storage, &SwapOperationState {
    user: alice_addr.clone(),
    recipient: alice_addr.clone(),
    // ... Alice's parameters
})?;

// Step 2: Bob overwrites state (before Alice's reply)
SWAP_OPERATION_STATE.save(deps.storage, &SwapOperationState {
    user: bob_addr.clone(),
    recipient: bob_addr.clone(),  // Bob's address!
    // ... Bob's parameters
})?;

// Step 3: Alice's SubMsg reply processes with Bob's state
let hijacked_state = SWAP_OPERATION_STATE.load(deps.storage)?; // Loads Bob's state
// Alice's funds sent to Bob's recipient address
```

### Exploitation Requirements:
- **Timing**: Attacker must execute between victim's swap initiation and SubMsg reply
- **Access**: Any user can call swap functions (normal functionality)
- **No Authentication**: No verification that state belongs to the calling user

## üí• Impact

**Classification: Critical - Direct theft of any user funds**

### Financial Impact:
- **Complete Fund Theft**: Attackers can steal 100% of victim's swap amount
- **No Amount Limit**: Works for swaps of any size
- **Repeatable Attack**: Can be executed against multiple victims
- **Zero Cost Attack**: Attacker only needs to pay gas fees

### Technical Impact:
- **State Corruption**: Global state becomes unreliable
- **Transaction Integrity**: Multi-step operations lose atomicity guarantees
- **System Trust**: Fundamental contract security assumptions broken

### Operational Impact:
- **Platform Shutdown**: Critical vulnerability requires immediate contract pause
- **User Exodus**: Complete loss of user trust in the platform
- **Regulatory Consequences**: Direct fund theft triggers legal/regulatory action

## ‚úÖ Remediation Recommendations

### Immediate Fix:
```rust
// Replace singleton with user-specific state storage
pub const SWAP_OPERATION_STATES: Map<&Addr, SwapOperationState> = Map::new("swap_operation_states");

// Secure state management
fn save_user_state(storage: &mut dyn Storage, user: &Addr, state: &SwapOperationState) -> StdResult<()> {
    SWAP_OPERATION_STATES.save(storage, user, state)
}

fn load_user_state(storage: &dyn Storage, user: &Addr) -> StdResult<SwapOperationState> {
    SWAP_OPERATION_STATES.load(storage, user)
}
```

### Comprehensive Solution:
1. **User-Specific State**: Replace singleton with per-user state mapping
2. **Access Control**: Verify state ownership before loading/modifying
3. **State Cleanup**: Remove completed swap states to prevent memory bloat
4. **Atomic Operations**: Ensure state consistency throughout multi-step operations

### Architecture Improvements:
```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub struct SwapOperationState {
    pub user: Addr,
    pub recipient: Addr,
    pub nonce: u64,  // Add nonce for additional security
    pub created_at: u64,  // Timestamp for cleanup
    // ... other fields
}

// Secure state operations with ownership verification
impl SwapOperationState {
    pub fn verify_ownership(&self, caller: &Addr) -> Result<(), ContractError> {
        if self.user != *caller {
            return Err(ContractError::Unauthorized);
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

## üîÅ Related Issues

This vulnerability indicates systemic issues:
- **Global State Pattern**: Other singletons may have similar vulnerabilities
- **Missing Access Control**: General lack of ownership verification
- **Reentrancy Risks**: Other multi-step operations may be vulnerable

        recipient: alice_addr.clone(),
        amount: Uint128::new(1000),
    };
    
    // Bob overwrites state
    let bob_addr = Addr::unchecked("bob");
    let bob_state = SwapOperationState {
        user: bob_addr.clone(),
        recipient: bob_addr.clone(),  // Bob's address
        amount: Uint128::new(500),

    // Simulate the attack
    SWAP_OPERATION_STATE.save(deps.as_mut().storage, &alice_state).unwrap();
    SWAP_OPERATION_STATE.save(deps.as_mut().storage, &bob_state).unwrap(); // Overwrites Alice
    
    // Alice's reply processes with Bob's state
    let loaded_state = SWAP_OPERATION_STATE.load(deps.as_ref().storage).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(loaded_state.recipient, bob_addr); // Alice's funds go to Bob!
}

#[test]
fn test_concurrent_swap_isolation() {
    // Test that multiple users can swap simultaneously without interference
    // This test should FAIL with current implementation
