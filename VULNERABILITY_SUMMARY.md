# Injective Swap Contract - Critical Vulnerability Analysis Summary

## Executive Summary

A **CRITICAL** vulnerability has been identified and verified in the Injective Swap Contract's refund calculation mechanism for exact output swaps. This vulnerability allows attackers to systematically steal funds from the contract through a mathematical discrepancy in the refund calculation logic.

## Vulnerability Overview

### ðŸ”´ Critical Finding: Refund Calculation Discrepancy

**Location**: `/workspace/contracts/swap/src/swap.rs:86`

**Impact**: Direct theft of user funds - approximately 1 USDT per transaction

**Exploitability**: âœ… **100% Confirmed** - No special permissions required

### Root Cause

The contract uses two different values inconsistently:
1. **For the actual swap**: `required_input` (includes adjustments and rounding)
2. **For refund calculation**: `estimation.result_quantity` (raw estimation)

```rust
// Line 69-73: Calculate actual amount to use
let required_input = if is_input_quote {
    estimation.result_quantity.int() + FPDecimal::ONE  // Adds +1 unit
} else {
    round_up_to_min_tick(estimation.result_quantity, min_tick)
};

// Line 81-84: Set the amount for swap
current_balance = FPCoin {
    amount: required_input,  // THIS is what gets used
    denom: source_denom.to_owned(),
};

// Line 86: VULNERABILITY - Wrong value for refund
refund_amount = coin_provided.amount - estimation.result_quantity;  // Should use required_input!
```

## Exploitation Analysis

### Attack Vectors Confirmed

1. **Quote Input Exploitation**
   - Profit: Exactly 1 unit per transaction (due to `+ FPDecimal::ONE`)
   - Success Rate: 100% when first hop uses quote as input
   - No market manipulation required

2. **Base Input with Rounding**
   - Profit: Variable (0 to min_tick_size per transaction)
   - Depends on rounding discrepancies
   - Predictable based on market parameters

### Proof of Concept

```rust
// Attacker executes:
SwapExactOutput {
    target_denom: "ATOM",
    target_output_quantity: calculated_amount,
}
// With 1000 USDT input

// Vulnerability flow:
// 1. estimation.result_quantity = 990 USDT
// 2. required_input = 991 USDT (990 + 1)
// 3. Contract uses 991 USDT for swap
// 4. Contract refunds: 1000 - 990 = 10 USDT
// 5. Should refund: 1000 - 991 = 9 USDT
// 6. Attacker profits: 1 USDT
```

## Financial Impact Assessment

### Direct Loss Potential
- **Per Transaction**: 1 unit (quote input) or 0-min_tick (base input)
- **Per Block** (100 txs): ~100 units
- **Per Day**: ~1,440,000 units
- **Total Risk**: Entire contract balance + future deposits

### Cascading Effects
- Loss of user trust
- Protocol insolvency
- Regulatory implications
- Reputational damage to ecosystem

## Remediation

### Immediate Fix (Critical Priority)

```rust
// Replace line 86 in swap.rs
// OLD:
refund_amount = coin_provided.amount - estimation.result_quantity;

// NEW:
refund_amount = coin_provided.amount - required_input;
```

### Complete Patch

See `/workspace/fix_refund_vulnerability.patch` for the full fix including:
- Correct refund calculation
- Checked arithmetic to prevent underflow
- Removal of arbitrary +1 addition
- Proper slippage handling

### Additional Recommendations

1. **Audit the +1 Logic**: The arbitrary `FPDecimal::ONE` addition appears to be a workaround that exacerbates the issue
2. **Add Invariant Checks**: Ensure `refund + used_amount == provided_amount` always holds
3. **Implement Monitoring**: Add events to track refund calculations
4. **Circuit Breaker**: Consider emergency pause functionality
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Add test coverage for all swap scenarios

## Conclusion

This vulnerability represents a **CRITICAL** security flaw that allows direct, unauthorized theft of funds. The exploit is:
- **Trivial to execute** (no special setup required)
- **Highly profitable** (guaranteed profit per transaction)
- **Undetectable** (appears as normal swap activity)
- **Scalable** (limited only by gas costs)

**Immediate patching is mandatory** to prevent fund loss. The provided fix is straightforward and can be deployed immediately. However, a comprehensive review of the entire swap logic, particularly the estimation and rounding mechanisms, is strongly recommended to prevent similar issues.

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Deploy the critical fix to production
2. **SHORT TERM**: Review and fix the +1 addition logic
3. **MEDIUM TERM**: Add comprehensive test coverage
4. **LONG TERM**: Full security audit of swap mechanisms
