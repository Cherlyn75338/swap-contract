# Atomic Order Token Swap Contract

The Swap contract allows instantly swapping between different tokens, using atomic market orders. If thereâ€™s no market that would allow performing such swap directly, contract will perform a necessary number of intermediary trades (for example if user wants to swap INJ to ATOM, contract will sell INJ to USDT and then buy ATOM with USDT).

## Messages

### Instantiate

Initializes the contract state with the contract version and configuration details. The config includes an administrator address and a fee recipient address.

```rust
pub fn instantiate(
    deps: DepsMut<InjectiveQueryWrapper>,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> Result<Response<InjectiveMsgWrapper>, ContractError>
```

### Execute

Handles different types of transactions and admin functions:

- SwapMinOutput: Swap with the minimum output quantity.
- SwapExactOutput: Swap with an exact output quantity.
- SetRoute: Set a swap route.
- DeleteRoute: Delete a swap route.
- UpdateConfig: Update the contract configuration.
- WithdrawSupportFunds: Withdraw the support funds from the contract.

```rust
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut<InjectiveQueryWrapper>,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response<InjectiveMsgWrapper>, ContractError>
```

### Reply

Handles the replies from other contracts or transactions.

```rust
pub fn reply(
    deps: DepsMut<InjectiveQueryWrapper>,
    env: Env,
    msg: Reply,
) -> Result<Response<InjectiveMsgWrapper>, ContractError>
```

### Query

Handles various queries to the contract:

- GetRoute: Get a specific swap route.
- GetOutputQuantity: Get the output quantity for a given input quantity.
- GetInputQuantity: Get the input quantity for a given output quantity.
- GetAllRoutes: Get all available swap routes.

```rust
pub fn query(deps: Deps<InjectiveQueryWrapper>, env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary>
```

## Leveraging the Atomic Order Token Swap Contract for Your Injective dApp

The Atomic Order Token Swap Contract offers a seamless integration for token swapping capabilities within your dApp or as an external smart contract.

There are 2 main ways you can use it:

### 1 - Utilization of HelixApp's Swap Contract

The contract is readily available on [Mainnet](https://explorer.injective.network/contract/inj1psk3468yr9teahgz73amwvpfjehnhczvkrhhqx/).

Advantages:

- Quick up and running token swapping capability.
- No need to lock up funds into the contract.

Limitations:

- Absence of configurability: You cannot set up or delete routes, update configurations, or withdraw support funds.
- Fee Allocation: Any generated fees will be directed towards HelixApp.

### 2 - New instance of our stored code

The code is readily available on [Mainnet](https://explorer.injective.network/code/67/), and you can instanciate it too.

Advantages:

- You retain complete control over the available routes.
- Administrative Privileges: Full administrative access to the contract.
- Fee Collection: Ability to collect fees.

Limitations:

- Need to lock around 500 USDT in the contract to guarantee its functionality.

Instantiate command:

```bash
INIT='{"admin":"'$YOUR_ADMIN_ADDRESS'", "fee_recipient":{"address": "'$YOUR_FEE_RECIPIENT_ADDRESS'"}}'
INSTANTIATE_TX_HASH=$(yes 12345678 | injectived tx wasm instantiate $code_id "$INIT" \
--label="Your dApp Swap Contract" \
--from=$USER --chain-id="$CHAIN_ID" --yes --admin=$USER $HOME --node=$NODE \
$GAS_AND_FEE $SYNC_MODE $KBT
```

### 3 - Upload and Instantiate Your Contract

Advantages:

- You retain complete control over the available routes.
- Administrative Privileges: Full administrative access to the contract.
- Fee Collection: Ability to collect fees.

Limitations:

- Complexity: This method requires a better understanding and needs a governance proposal.
- Need to lock around 500 USDT in the contract to guarantee its functionality.

### Disclaimer

This contract is developed with precision and rigor but hasn't undergone an external audit. Proceed with discretion, understanding that use of this contract comes with inherent risks.

## How to Use

Install [cargo-make](https://sagiegurari.github.io/cargo-make/):

```sh
cargo install --force cargo-make
```

Run formatter:

```sh
cargo make fmt
```

Run tests:

```sh
cargo make test
```

Run linter (clippy):

```sh
cargo make lint
```

Check for unused dependencies:

```sh
cargo make udeps
```

Compile all contracts using [rust-optimizer](https://github.com/CosmWasm/rust-optimizer):

```sh
cargo make optimize
```

Once optimized, verify the wasm binaries are ready to be uploaded to the blockchain:

```sh
cargo make check
```

Generate JSON schema for all contracts:

```sh
cargo make schema
```

Publish contracts and packages to [crates.io](https://crates.io/):

```sh
cargo make publish
```

**NOTE:** For the last two tasks (schema and publish), you need to update the shell script in [`Makefile.toml`](./Makefile.toml) for them to work.
