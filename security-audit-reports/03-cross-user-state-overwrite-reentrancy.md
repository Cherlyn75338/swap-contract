# Cross-User State Overwrite Vulnerability in SWAP_OPERATION_STATE

## Project: Injective Swap Contract (contracts/swap/src/state.rs, contracts/swap/src/swap.rs)

## Severity: Critical

## Category: Reentrancy / State Management / Access Control

---

## üîç Description
A critical vulnerability exists in the `SWAP_OPERATION_STATE` singleton that allows cross-user state overwrites, enabling an attacker to hijack a victim's multi-step swap operation. During a `SubMsg` reply, the attacker's overwritten state is loaded instead of the victim's original state, redirecting the victim's funds to the attacker. This represents a classic reentrancy attack pattern that leads to direct fund theft.

## üìú Affected Code
```rust
// Location: contracts/swap/src/state.rs
// The SWAP_OPERATION_STATE singleton is vulnerable to cross-user overwrites

// Location: contracts/swap/src/swap.rs
// During SubMsg reply handling, the overwritten state is loaded

// Vulnerable pattern:
// 1. User A starts swap operation
// 2. User B overwrites the global state
// 3. When SubMsg reply executes, User B's state is loaded
// 4. User A's funds are redirected to User B
```

## üß† Root Cause
The root cause is the use of a global singleton state (`SWAP_OPERATION_STATE`) that can be overwritten by any user during the execution of multi-step swap operations. This creates a race condition where:

1. **State Sharing:** Multiple users share the same global state variable
2. **No Isolation:** There's no mechanism to isolate state between different user operations
3. **Timing Attack:** An attacker can overwrite the state between the initial swap call and the SubMsg reply
4. **State Confusion:** The reply handler loads whatever state is currently in the global variable

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Exploitability
**Yes, this vulnerability is highly exploitable.**

**Exploitation Method:**
1. **Setup Phase:** Attacker monitors for victim swap operations
2. **Race Condition:** When victim initiates a swap, attacker immediately calls the same function
3. **State Overwrite:** Attacker's state overwrites the victim's state in `SWAP_OPERATION_STATE`
4. **Fund Redirection:** When the SubMsg reply executes, attacker's state is loaded
5. **Fund Theft:** Victim's funds are redirected to attacker's address

**Attack Timeline:**
```
T0: Victim calls start_swap_flow() ‚Üí State A stored
T1: Attacker calls start_swap_flow() ‚Üí State A overwritten with State B
T2: SubMsg reply executes ‚Üí State B loaded instead of State A
T3: Victim's funds redirected to attacker
```

## üí• Impact
**Critical** - This vulnerability directly results in:
- **Direct theft of user funds** (in-motion and at-rest)
- **Complete compromise** of the swap functionality
- **Loss of all user funds** in the contract
- **Protocol abandonment** due to fund security failure
- **Regulatory and legal implications** due to massive fund theft

## ‚úÖ Remediation Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes:
1. **Implement User-Specific State Storage:**
   ```rust
   // Instead of global singleton:
   // pub static SWAP_OPERATION_STATE: Item<SwapOperationState> = Item::new("swap_op_state");
   
   // Use user-specific storage:
   pub fn get_user_swap_state(user: &Addr) -> Item<SwapOperationState> {
       Item::new(&format!("swap_op_state_{}", user))
   }
   ```

2. **Add State Isolation:**
   ```rust
   // Ensure each user operation has isolated state
   let user_state_key = format!("swap_op_{}_{}", user, operation_id);
   let user_state: Item<SwapOperationState> = Item::new(&user_state_key);
   ```

3. **Implement State Validation:**
   ```rust
   // Validate state ownership before processing
   if state.user != info.sender {
       return Err(StdError::generic_err("Unauthorized state access"));
   }
   ```

### Long-term Improvements:
1. **Implement proper state management patterns** with user isolation
2. **Add reentrancy guards** using nonce-based or lock-based mechanisms
3. **Implement state cleanup** after operation completion
4. **Add comprehensive logging** for all state modifications
5. **Implement circuit breakers** to halt operations if suspicious activity detected

## üîÅ Related Issues
- This vulnerability affects the entire swap functionality
- May compound with other vulnerabilities to create more severe attack vectors
- Related to the overall state management architecture

## üß™ Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Cross-User State Overwrite
```rust
#[test]
fn test_cross_user_state_overwrite() {
    let mut deps = mock_dependencies();
    
    // User A starts swap
    let user_a = Addr::unchecked("user_a");
    let msg_a = ExecuteMsg::StartSwapFlow { /* ... */ };
    let info_a = mock_info(&user_a, &[]);
    
    let result_a = execute(deps.as_mut(), mock_env(), info_a, msg_a);
    assert!(result_a.is_ok());
    
    // User B overwrites state
    let user_b = Addr::unchecked("user_b");
    let msg_b = ExecuteMsg::StartSwapFlow { /* ... */ };
    let info_b = mock_info(&user_b, &[]);
    
    let result_b = execute(deps.as_mut(), mock_env(), info_b, msg_b);
    assert!(result_b.is_ok());
    
    // Verify User A's state was overwritten
    let state = SWAP_OPERATION_STATE.load(&deps.storage).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(state.user, user_b); // This should fail if fixed
}
```

### Test Case 2: Reentrancy Attack Simulation
```rust
#[test]
fn test_reentrancy_attack_simulation() {
    let mut deps = mock_dependencies();
    
    // Simulate the race condition
    let user_a = Addr::unchecked("user_a");
    let user_b = Addr::unchecked("user_b");
    
    // Both users attempt to start swaps simultaneously
    let msg = ExecuteMsg::StartSwapFlow { /* ... */ };
    
    // Execute in parallel (simulated)
    let info_a = mock_info(&user_a, &[]);
    let info_b = mock_info(&user_b, &[]);
    
    let _result_a = execute(deps.as_mut(), mock_env(), info_a, msg.clone());
    let _result_b = execute(deps.as_mut(), mock_env(), info_b, msg);
    
    // Verify only one state exists and it's properly isolated
    // This test should pass after the fix is implemented
}
```

### Test Case 3: State Isolation Verification
```rust
#[test]
fn test_state_isolation() {
    let mut deps = mock_dependencies();
    
    // Multiple users should have separate states
    let users = vec!["user_a", "user_b", "user_c"];
    
    for user in &users {
        let msg = ExecuteMsg::StartSwapFlow { /* ... */ };
        let info = mock_info(user, &[]);
        let result = execute(deps.as_mut(), mock_env(), info, msg);
        assert!(result.is_ok());
    }
    
    // Verify each user has isolated state
    for user in &users {
        let user_state = get_user_swap_state(&Addr::unchecked(user));
        assert!(user_state.load(&deps.storage).is_ok());
    }
}
```

## üìä Additional Notes
- This is the most critical vulnerability identified as it allows direct fund theft
- The fix requires architectural changes to the state management system
- Consider implementing a complete rewrite of the state management logic
- Add extensive testing for race conditions and concurrent access patterns
- Implement monitoring for suspicious state modification patterns
