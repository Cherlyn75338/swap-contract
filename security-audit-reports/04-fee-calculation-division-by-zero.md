# Fee Calculation Division by Zero Vulnerability

## Project: Injective Swap Contract (contracts/swap/src/queries.rs)

## Severity: Medium

## Category: Arithmetic / Division by Zero / DoS

---

## üîç Description
A vulnerability exists in the fee calculation logic where extreme values of `fee_percent` can lead to division by zero errors. The proposed fix includes adding `MAX_FEE_PERCENT` constants and bounds checks to prevent division by zero from extreme fee percentages, which could cause transaction failures and denial of service attacks.

## üìú Affected Code
```rust
// Location: contracts/swap/src/queries.rs
// The vulnerability occurs in fee calculation functions

// Vulnerable pattern (before fix):
let fee_amount = total_amount * fee_percent / 100; // Can cause division by zero if fee_percent is extreme

// Proposed fix:
const MAX_FEE_PERCENT: u64 = 1000; // Maximum 10% fee
if fee_percent > MAX_FEE_PERCENT {
    return Err(StdError::generic_err("Fee percentage too high"));
}
let fee_amount = total_amount.checked_mul(fee_percent)?.checked_div(100)?;
```

## üß† Root Cause
The root cause is the lack of bounds checking on `fee_percent` values before performing arithmetic operations. When `fee_percent` contains extreme values (either very large numbers or zero), the division operation can fail or produce unexpected results. This is particularly problematic in smart contracts where arithmetic failures can cause entire transactions to fail.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Exploitability
**Yes, this vulnerability is exploitable.**

**Exploitation Method:**
1. **DoS Attack:** An attacker can submit transactions with extreme `fee_percent` values
2. **Transaction Failure:** Division by zero or arithmetic overflow causes transaction failures
3. **Service Disruption:** Multiple failed transactions can disrupt the swap service
4. **Resource Consumption:** Failed transactions consume gas and block space

**Attack Scenarios:**
- Submitting `fee_percent = 0` to trigger division by zero
- Submitting extremely large `fee_percent` values to cause arithmetic overflow
- Spamming the contract with malformed fee parameters

## üí• Impact
**Medium** - This vulnerability results in:
- **Denial of service** attacks against the swap functionality
- **Transaction failures** that affect user experience
- **Resource consumption** through failed transactions
- **Potential fund locking** if fee calculations fail during active swaps

## ‚úÖ Remediation Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes:
1. **Add Bounds Checking:**
   ```rust
   // Define maximum fee percentage
   const MAX_FEE_PERCENT: u64 = 1000; // 10% maximum
   const MIN_FEE_PERCENT: u64 = 1;    // 0.01% minimum
   
   // Validate fee percentage before calculation
   if fee_percent < MIN_FEE_PERCENT || fee_percent > MAX_FEE_PERCENT {
       return Err(StdError::generic_err(format!(
           "Fee percentage must be between {} and {}",
           MIN_FEE_PERCENT, MAX_FEE_PERCENT
       )));
   }
   ```

2. **Use Safe Arithmetic Operations:**
   ```rust
   // Replace unsafe arithmetic with checked operations
   let fee_amount = total_amount
       .checked_mul(fee_percent)
       .ok_or_else(|| StdError::generic_err("Fee calculation overflow"))?
       .checked_div(100)
       .ok_or_else(|| StdError::generic_err("Fee calculation division error"))?;
   ```

3. **Implement Fee Validation:**
   ```rust
   // Add comprehensive fee validation
   pub fn validate_fee_percentage(fee_percent: u64) -> Result<(), StdError> {
       if fee_percent == 0 {
           return Err(StdError::generic_err("Fee percentage cannot be zero"));
       }
       
       if fee_percent > MAX_FEE_PERCENT {
           return Err(StdError::generic_err("Fee percentage exceeds maximum allowed"));
       }
       
       Ok(())
   }
   ```

### Long-term Improvements:
1. **Implement fee parameter sanitization** at the entry point
2. **Add comprehensive input validation** for all fee-related parameters
3. **Implement circuit breakers** for fee calculation failures
4. **Add monitoring and alerting** for unusual fee patterns
5. **Implement fee calculation caching** to reduce computational overhead

fn test_fee_calculation_division_by_zero() {
    let total_amount = Uint128::new(1000);
    let fee_percent = 0;
    
    // This should return an error, not panic
    let result = calculate_fee_amount(total_amount, fee_percent);
    assert!(result.is_err());
    
    // Verify error message
    if let Err(StdError::GenericErr { msg }) = result {
        assert!(msg.contains("Fee percentage cannot be zero"));
    }
}
```

```rust
#[test]
fn test_fee_calculation_extreme_values() {
    let total_amount = Uint128::new(1000);
    
    // Test with maximum allowed fee percentage
    let max_fee = MAX_FEE_PERCENT;
    let result = calculate_fee_amount(total_amount, max_fee);
    assert!(result.is_ok());
    
    // Test with fee percentage exceeding maximum
    let excessive_fee = MAX_FEE_PERCENT + 1;
    let result = calculate_fee_amount(total_amount, excessive_fee);
    assert!(result.is_err());

fn test_fee_calculation_safe_arithmetic() {
    let total_amount = Uint128::MAX;
    let fee_percent = 100; // 1%
    
    // This should handle large numbers safely
    let result = calculate_fee_amount(total_amount, fee_percent);
    assert!(result.is_ok());
    
    // Verify the calculation is mathematically correct
    let fee_amount = result.unwrap();
    let expected_fee = total_amount.checked_mul(fee_percent).unwrap().checked_div(100).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(fee_amount, expected_fee);
}
```

    let result = calculate_fee_amount(total_amount, min_fee);
    assert!(result.is_ok());
    
    // Test with very small amounts

    let result = calculate_fee_amount(small_amount, min_fee);
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}
```

## üìä Additional Notes
- The severity is classified as Medium because while it can cause DoS, it doesn't directly lead to fund theft
- However, in combination with other vulnerabilities, this could create more severe attack vectors
- The proposed fix with `MAX_FEE_PERCENT` and bounds checking is a good approach
- Consider implementing additional validation for fee calculation inputs
- Add comprehensive testing for edge cases and boundary conditions
