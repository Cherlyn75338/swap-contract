# [Issue D] Critical: Multi-transaction "stepper" flows using singleton state are vulnerable

## üìå Project / File / Module
**Contracts that use multiple user/keeper calls (execute1 ‚Üí execute2 ‚Üí execute3‚Ä¶) and store "current swap" in a singleton between calls**

**Affected Files:**
- `contracts/swap/src/state.rs` - Defines singleton storage items
- `contracts/swap/src/swap.rs` - Contains multi-step swap execution logic
- `contracts/swap/src/contract.rs` - Entry points for contract execution

## üß≠ Severity
**Critical (Smart Contracts): State hijack / theft**

## üìö Category
**State machine correctness / storage collision**

## üîç Full Technical Description
Any multi-transaction workflow that keeps its "working set" in a singleton lets the next caller completely replace it. If later steps use that state to send funds, attacker captures them.

The contract implements a multi-step swap mechanism where:
1. `start_swap_flow` initializes global state in `SWAP_OPERATION_STATE`
2. `execute_swap_step` processes individual steps recursively
3. State persists across multiple function calls within the same transaction
4. If this were extended to multi-transaction flows, the singleton state would be vulnerable

## üßµ Code Dissection

### Pattern Analysis
```rust
// In start_swap_flow (lines 99-100)
SWAP_OPERATION_STATE.save(deps.storage, &swap_operation)?;

// In execute_swap_step (line 214) - recursive multi-step execution
return execute_swap_step(deps, env, swap, current_step.step_idx + 1, new_balance)
    .map_err(ContractError::Std);
```

### Current Implementation Analysis
The current implementation uses recursive calls within the same transaction, which is safe under CosmWasm's atomic execution model. However, the architecture is designed to support multi-step operations and could easily be extended to multi-transaction flows.

### Vulnerable Pattern (if extended to multi-tx)
```rust
// Hypothetical vulnerable multi-tx pattern:
// Step 1: User A starts swap
SWAP_OPERATION_STATE.save(storage, &op1)?;
// Transaction ends, state persists

// Step 2: User B (attacker) starts different swap
SWAP_OPERATION_STATE.save(storage, &op2)?; // Overwrites User A's state
// Transaction ends, state persists

// Step 3: Keeper or system progresses User A's swap
let op = SWAP_OPERATION_STATE.load(storage)?; // Loads User B's state!
// Funds sent to User B instead of User A
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Root Cause
**Lack of per-operation isolation and ownership binding across multiple transactions.**

The contract uses global singleton storage (`Item<T>`) for multi-step operations without:
- Per-operation keying
- Ownership verification across steps
- Correlation between operation initiation and progression

## üí• Exploitability
**Is it exploitable: ‚úÖ Yes (if extended to multi-tx flows)**

**Prerequisites:**
- Multi-transaction progression and singleton state used as memory
- No per-user/per-op keying and no ownership checks on step progression
- External keepers or users can trigger step progression

**Current Status:**
The current implementation is **NOT directly exploitable** because it uses recursive calls within the same transaction. However, the architecture is **critically vulnerable** if extended to multi-transaction flows, which is a common pattern in production DeFi systems.

## üéØ Exploit Scenario
**Multi-Transaction Stepper Attack:**

1. **Victim (User A)** initiates a large swap operation
   - `SWAP_OPERATION_STATE` contains User A's swap details
   - Transaction completes, state persists in singleton

2. **Attacker (User B)** initiates a small swap operation
   - `SWAP_OPERATION_STATE` is overwritten with User B's details
   - Transaction completes, state persists in singleton

3. **Keeper or system** progresses the swap operation
   - Reads `SWAP_OPERATION_STATE` (now contains User B's data)
   - Processes the swap using User B's parameters
   - Sends funds to User B instead of User A

**Result:** Complete theft of User A's swap proceeds

## üìâ Financial/System Impact
**Direct redirection of any final payout driven by the state.**

**Impact Scale:**
- **Individual Impact:** Full redirection of swap proceeds (100% fund theft)
- **Systemic Impact:** Complete loss of trust in the swap mechanism
- **Repeatability:** Unlimited - every multi-transaction flow is vulnerable

**Upper Bound:** Equal to the largest single in-flight swap amount

## üß∞ Mitigations Present
**None, unless controller patterns are enforced.**

The current implementation relies on CosmWasm's atomic execution within single transactions, but has no protection against multi-transaction state corruption.

## üß¨ Remediation Recommendations

### 1. Replace Singleton with Keyed Storage
```rust
// Instead of:
pub const SWAP_OPERATION_STATE: Item<CurrentSwapOperation> = Item::new("current_swap_cache");

// Use:
pub const SWAP_OPERATIONS: Map<(Addr, u64), CurrentSwapOperation> = Map::new("swap_operations");
```

### 2. Implement Operation Correlation
```rust
// Generate unique operation ID for each swap
let operation_id = generate_operation_id(&env, &info.sender);

// Store with correlation key
SWAP_OPERATIONS.save(deps.storage, (info.sender.clone(), operation_id), &swap_operation)?;

// Return operation ID to user for future reference
```

### 3. Enforce Ownership Verification
```rust
// In step progression functions, verify ownership
let operation = SWAP_OPERATIONS.load(deps.storage, (info.sender.clone(), operation_id))?;

// Only allow owner or authenticated keeper to progress
if info.sender != operation.owner && !is_authenticated_keeper(&info.sender) {
    return Err(ContractError::Unauthorized);
}
```

### 4. Implement Operation Expiration
```rust
// Add timestamp to operations
pub struct CurrentSwapOperation {
    pub owner: Addr,
    pub operation_id: u64,
    pub created_at: u64,
    pub expires_at: u64,
    // ... other fields
}

// Clean up expired operations
pub fn cleanup_expired_operations(deps: DepsMut, env: &Env) -> Result<(), ContractError> {
    // Implementation to remove expired operations
}
```

### 5. State Machine Validation
```rust
// Ensure step progression follows valid state transitions
pub enum SwapStep {
    Initiated,
    OrderPlaced,
    OrderFilled,
    Completed,
}

// Validate step transitions
pub fn validate_step_transition(current: SwapStep, next: SwapStep) -> Result<(), ContractError> {
    match (current, next) {
        (SwapStep::Initiated, SwapStep::OrderPlaced) => Ok(()),
        (SwapStep::OrderPlaced, SwapStep::OrderFilled) => Ok(()),
        (SwapStep::OrderFilled, SwapStep::Completed) => Ok(()),
        _ => Err(ContractError::InvalidStepTransition),
    }
}
```

## üß™ Suggested Tests

### Test 1: Multi-Transaction State Corruption
```rust
#[test]
fn test_multi_transaction_state_corruption() {
    // 1. Victim starts swap (simulate transaction 1)
    let victim_swap = create_swap_operation("victim", 1000);
    SWAP_OPERATION_STATE.save(&mut storage, &victim_swap).unwrap();
    
    // 2. Attacker overwrites state (simulate transaction 2)
    let attacker_swap = create_swap_operation("attacker", 1);
    SWAP_OPERATION_STATE.save(&mut storage, &attacker_swap).unwrap();
    
    // 3. System progresses victim's swap
    let current_state = SWAP_OPERATION_STATE.load(&storage).unwrap();
    
    // Assert: State contains attacker's data, not victim's
    assert_eq!(current_state.sender_address, "attacker");
    assert_eq!(current_state.amount, 1);
    
    // Result: Funds will be sent to attacker instead of victim
}
```

### Test 2: Keyed Storage Fix Verification
```rust
#[test]
fn test_keyed_storage_isolation() {
    // 1. Victim starts swap with operation ID
    let victim_op_id = 1;
    let victim_swap = create_swap_operation("victim", 1000);
    SWAP_OPERATIONS.save(&mut storage, ("victim", victim_op_id), &victim_swap).unwrap();
    
    // 2. Attacker starts different swap with different operation ID
    let attacker_op_id = 2;
    let attacker_swap = create_swap_operation("attacker", 1);
    SWAP_OPERATIONS.save(&mut storage, ("attacker", attacker_op_id), &attacker_swap).unwrap();
    
    // 3. System progresses victim's specific operation
    let victim_state = SWAP_OPERATIONS.load(&storage, ("victim", victim_op_id)).unwrap();
    let attacker_state = SWAP_OPERATIONS.load(&storage, ("attacker", attacker_op_id)).unwrap();
    
    // Assert: Each operation maintains its own state
    assert_eq!(victim_state.sender_address, "victim");
    assert_eq!(attacker_state.sender_address, "attacker");
    
    // Result: No state corruption, each operation isolated
}
```

- **Issue C**: Reentrancy variant (same transaction)
- **Issue D**: Multi-transaction variant (human-driven progression)

## üìã Summary
The contract's current multi-step implementation is safe due to single-transaction atomic execution, but the **architecture is critically vulnerable** to multi-transaction state corruption. The use of global singleton storage without operation correlation creates a fundamental flaw that would allow complete fund theft if extended to multi-transaction flows.

**Immediate Action Required:** Refactor storage architecture to use keyed storage with operation correlation before implementing any multi-transaction functionality.

**Risk Level:** CRITICAL - Complete fund theft vulnerability under multi-transaction scenarios
